# Impact website

This is based on a lovely [material design template](https://github.com/joashp/material-design-template) from [Joash Pereira](http://joashpereira.com). It is a single page website with all content contained in `index.html`.

The CSS framework is [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/). We also uses icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). See those links for docs or use Google to find related tutorials.
